# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx

## Challenges
At first, I got confused when I tried to upload my project to GitHub because my remote link was still set to your-username and not beaglrz. This gave me a “repository not found” error. I also made a small mistake in the push command by forgetting a space between origin and main. I fixed these problems by checking the remote link with git remote -v, changing it to the right GitHub address using git remote set-url, and then running the correct git push -u origin main command. After that, the project uploaded without any problems.

Add a screenshot of your rendered component (you can drag and drop it here if using GitHub web interface).
